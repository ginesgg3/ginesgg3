-  Hi, my name is Ginés. I'm a physicist and I'll be adding here some of the projects that I have worked in and future projects.
-  I’m interested in everything related to physics, but specially in physics of materials. I'm also interested in data science and programming tools to solve problems in physics.
-  I’m currently studying a master's degree in physics of materials at the University of Valladolid. I'm learning new things about data science with python too.
