I am thankful if you are reading this. Here it is the description of my BSc Thesis in Physics. It was my first research project with really advance equipment. 
I used an Atomic force microscopy (AFM) or scanning force microscopy (SFM) to characterize the electronic properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) and reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) at the nanoscale.
For this purpose, I used a technique called Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) with which it is possible to measure the electrostatic interactions between the tip of the microscope and the sample.
If you want to know more you can read the project and the presentation.
